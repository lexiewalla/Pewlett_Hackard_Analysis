# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
module 7


### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to sort through extremely large data sets using structured query language, SQL, and databases. In this module we learned how to write bits of code to create queries to pull information from CSV files into a database. We learned how to take multiple CSV files with like columns and created new tables with different bits of information from each CSV file we wanted. From there we were able to export the new tables we created into CSV files. 

In this module, we are helping the company Pewlett Hackard sift through their employees to try to get a gauge of how many will be retiring soon. We started out with six different files all containing different information about employees. Within all these files there was the employees first and last names, employee ID numbers, departments, department numbers, titles, salaries, start and end dates, birth dates and titles. We first filtered out the employees who had birthdays from 1-1-1952 and 12-31-1955 to see how many employees are near the retiring age. We found that this list was entirely too large and had to break it down even further. Building a different series of queries, we were able to build tables with the employees of that age range, that still currently worked here. We then broke it down a little bit further to see what each employee’s titles are to see which departments they would be losing the most employees. 


### Results
•	From the analysis we have found that there are approximately 90,398 employees in the retiring age, WOW.

•	From those ~90,000 employees they are from 7 different departments with the senior engineering staff being the largest at about 29, 414 and assistant engineer being the smallest at about 1700. 

•	The department losing the most employees is the Engineering department losing approximately 45,397 employees 

•	There are 1939 employees’ eligible for the mentor ship program and approximately 940 of these employee’s are working within the Engineering department. However, from the 1939 employee’s, 476 of them no longer work at the company. 


### Summary 
The analysis has shown that Pewlett Hackard are going to be losing a significant amount of employees in the near future. On the bright side, they will only be losing two managers. Luckily there are no employee’s retiring from the HR department because there are going to need that staff when it comes to hiring.There are approximately 1,953 employees in the HR deptartment. That is a good amount of employees to have int he HR department to hire more employees. Yes, there are a lot of people retiring but there are a lot of people who are staying with the company. I made a table showing all the current employees and their current titles, even though it’s a large table it has all of the employee information listed in one place.
